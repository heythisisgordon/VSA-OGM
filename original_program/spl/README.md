## Semantic Pointer Library

A Python-based library for developing and applying semantic pointers with CUDA acceleration.

---

### Installation

The Semantic Pointer Library is wrapped together as a single pip package. You must pre-install pytorch depending on your specific machine. You can locally install the library with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

It has currently been tested on MacOS and Ubuntu with CPU and CUDA 11.7. Other operating systems and CUDA versions should be supported but it has not been formally tested.

### Tutorials

We have included a series of notebooks detailing the basic properties of high dimensional vectors [here](./notebooks/). The initial notebooks highlight the unique probabilistic properties of semantic pointers along with how to encode time and spatial information in 2D spaces.

We will be expanding the scope of these notebooks in the future. However, if you have a specific question and would like to see a certain tutorial, please reach out to the corresponding author.
