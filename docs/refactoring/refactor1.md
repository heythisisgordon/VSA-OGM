# Grid-Based Sequential VSA-OGM Mapping Pipeline

Here's an outline for a Grid-Based Sequential VSA-OGM mapping pipeline that treats each sampling point like a robot pose keyframe. Grid-Based Sequential VSA-OGM Mapping offers a systematic approach to converting a single, final 2D point cloud into a probabilistic occupancy grid mapping (OGM) using Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA). Unlike batch processing of an entire point cloud, this method samples observation points at regular intervals across a grid pattern, processing only local points within range of an emulated sensor at each location. By treating each grid point as a robot pose keyframe, it mimics realistic exploration while avoiding redundant computation.

## 1. Initialization
- Set up environment bounds (X meters Ã— Y meters)
- Define grid sampling resolution (e.g., every 5m)
- Set emulated sensor characteristics (10m range, 360 degrees, 1 degree beam spacing)
- Initialize empty global map structure
- Create VSA components (axis vectors, vector cache, spatial index)
- Define VSA parameters (dimensionality, length scale, disk filter radii)

## 2. Generate Sampling Grid
- Create grid of potential sampling points
- Filter out points that would fall in known occupied spaces using spatial indexing
- Create traversal order for efficient processing

## 3. Sequential Processing Loop
For each sampling point in the traversal order:
  - Extract local point cloud (points within sensor range of 10m)
  - Filter points based on sensor model (visibility, ray-casting for occlusion)
  - Process only these local points using VSA operations:
    - Encode points into VSA representation using vector cache
    - Update occupied and empty probability grids
    - Maintain memory usage by monitoring and clearing cache when needed
  - Update global map with new information
  - Update occupancy knowledge to refine future sampling locations

## 4. Feature Extraction
- Apply Shannon entropy to enhance feature extraction and reduce noise:
  - Use different disk filter radii for occupied and empty spaces
  - Calculate local entropy for each class
  - Combine into global entropy grid
  - Update class grid based on entropy values

## 5. Visualization & Output
- Generate occupancy grid maps for visualization
- Output probability heatmaps and entropy grids
- Calculate confidence metrics

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory-Aware Processing
```python
def process_sample_point(self, sample_point, global_point_cloud):
    # Extract local point cloud within sensor range
    local_points = self.spatial_index.query_range(sample_point, self.sensor_range)
    
    # Filter based on visibility/occlusion
    visible_points, visible_labels = local_points
    
    # Process points with memory monitoring
    self._process_points_spatially(visible_points, visible_labels)
    
    # Check memory usage and clear cache if needed
    self.check_memory_usage()
```

### Entropy-Based Feature Extraction
```python
def _apply_shannon_entropy(self):
    # Create disk filters with configurable radii
    occupied_disk = self._create_disk_filter(self.occupied_disk_radius)
    empty_disk = self._create_disk_filter(self.empty_disk_radius)
    
    # Normalize occupied and empty grids to get probability maps
    occupied_prob = self._normalize_grid(self.occupied_grid)
    empty_prob = self._normalize_grid(self.empty_grid)
    
    # Apply Born rule: true probability = squared quasi-probability
    occupied_prob = occupied_prob ** 2
    empty_prob = empty_prob ** 2
    
    # Calculate local entropy for occupied and empty grids
    self.occupied_entropy_grid = self._apply_local_entropy(occupied_prob, occupied_disk)
    self.empty_entropy_grid = self._apply_local_entropy(empty_prob, empty_disk)
    
    # Calculate global entropy as the difference between occupied and empty entropy
    self.global_entropy_grid = self.occupied_entropy_grid - self.empty_entropy_grid
```

### Efficient Spatial Indexing
```python
def is_region_free(self, bounds, safety_margin):
    # Expand bounds by safety margin
    expanded_bounds = [
        bounds[0] - safety_margin,
        bounds[1] + safety_margin,
        bounds[2] - safety_margin,
        bounds[3] + safety_margin
    ]
    
    # Check if any occupied points are within safety margin
    for cell in self._get_cells_in_bounds(expanded_bounds):
        if self._has_occupied_points_in_cell(cell, bounds, safety_margin):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This approach maintains the key advantages of VSA-OGM (efficient updates, probabilistic representation) while processing data in a way that mimics robot exploration, greatly improving performance over batch processing the entire point cloud at once.

This updated snippet aligns refactor1.md with the later implementation details, particularly regarding:

1. The VSA components structure (vector cache, spatial index)
2. The memory management approach
3. The Shannon entropy feature extraction with configurable disk filter radii
4. The spatial indexing with safety margin checking
