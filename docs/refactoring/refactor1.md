# Grid-Based Sequential VSA-OGM Mapping Pipeline

Here's an outline for a Grid-Based Sequential VSA-OGM mapping pipeline that treats each sampling point like a robot pose keyframe:

## 1. Initialization
- Set up environment bounds (200m Ã— 200m tunnel system)
- Define grid sampling resolution (e.g., every 5m)
- Set sensor characteristics (range, field of view)
- Initialize empty global map structure
- Create VSA components (axis vectors, initial quadrant memories)

## 2. Generate Sampling Grid
- Create grid of potential sampling points
- Filter out points that would fall in known occupied spaces
- Create traversal order (could be spiral from center, raster scan, etc.)

## 3. Sequential Processing Loop
For each sampling point in the traversal order:
  - Extract local point cloud (points within sensor range)
  - Filter points based on sensor model (visibility, occlusion)
  - Process only these local points using VSA operations:
    - Encode points into VSA representation
    - Update only the quadrant memories affected by these points
    - Maintain quadrant-level processing for efficiency
  - Update global map with new information
  - Update occupancy knowledge to refine future sampling locations

## 4. Map Maintenance
- Normalize memory vectors after updates
- Implement memory cleanup for areas with high confidence
- Apply Shannon entropy to enhance feature extraction
- Maintain sparse representation for efficiency

## 5. Visualization & Output
- Generate occupancy grid maps for visualization
- Output probability heatmaps
- Calculate confidence metrics

## Implementation Considerations

### Local Processing
```python
def process_sample_point(self, sample_point, global_point_cloud):
    # Extract local point cloud within sensor range
    local_points = extract_points_within_range(sample_point, global_point_cloud, self.sensor_range)
    
    # Filter based on visibility/occlusion
    visible_points = apply_visibility_filter(sample_point, local_points)
    
    # Process only these points (much smaller batch)
    self.process_observation(visible_points, visible_points_labels)
    
    # Only update affected quadrants (not the entire map)
    affected_quadrants = identify_affected_quadrants(visible_points)
    update_quadrant_memories(affected_quadrants)
```

### Incremental Map Building
```python
def build_map_sequentially(self, point_cloud, sampling_resolution=5.0):
    # Create sampling grid
    sampling_points = generate_sampling_grid(self.world_bounds, sampling_resolution)
    
    # Filter out occupied sampling locations
    valid_sampling_points = filter_unoccupied_locations(sampling_points, self.current_map)
    
    # Process each sampling point sequentially
    for sample_point in valid_sampling_points:
        self.process_sample_point(sample_point, point_cloud)
        
        # Optional: visualize incremental map building
        if self.verbose:
            self.visualize_current_map()
```

This pipeline maintains the key advantages of VSA-OGM (efficient updates, probabilistic representation) while processing data in a way that mimics robot exploration, greatly improving performance over batch processing the entire point cloud at once.
